Eclipse Plugin for GraphWalker

GraphWalker (http://graphwalker.github.io) is an open source Model-based testing tool for test automation. It's designed to make it easy to design your tests using graphs. It reads models in the shape of directed graphs, and generate [test] paths from these graphs. The plugin provides the ability to use GraphWalker directly in Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org) and provides an integrated editor for GraphWalker graphs editing. In addition to the GraphWalker standard features, you will also benefit within your workbench of the following: GraphWalker Online and Offline Tests code generators, automated analyzes and checks of graphs, refactoring, and ability to run and debug GraphWalker tests.
