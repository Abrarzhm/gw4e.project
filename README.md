Eclipse Plugins for GraphWalker

GraphWalker (http://graphwalker.github.io) is an open source Model-based testing tool for test automation. It's designed to make it easy to design your tests using graphs. It reads models in the shape of directed graphs, and generate [test] paths from these graphs. Paths generation can be controlled using different algorithms and executed dynamically (online) or statically (offline - paths generation). The goal of this project is to provide an Eclipse development environment for GraphWalker projects. The plugin provides the ability to use GraphWalker directly in Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org) and provides an integrated editor for GraphWalker graphs editing. In addition to the GraphWalker standard features, you will also benefit within your workbench of the following: GraphWalker Online and Offline Tests code generators, automated analyzes and checks of graphs, refactoring, and ability to run and debug GraphWalker tests. Cherry on the cake, you will also have the abilities to generate manual tests from the graphs in a spreadsheet.
