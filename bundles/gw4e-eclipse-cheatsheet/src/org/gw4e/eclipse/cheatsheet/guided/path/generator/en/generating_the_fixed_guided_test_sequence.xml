      <description>
         1 - In the <b>Package Explorer</b>, right-click the <b>src/main/java/com.company/SimpleStatic.java</b> file and select <b>Run As</b> -&gt; <b>Java Application</b> <br/>
     	  You can see the result execution in the Eclipse output console.  <br/>
     	<br/> 
     	  <b>Tips: </b>  <br/>
     	 As you might have noticed, the context given to the GraphWalker machine is not directly your existing test.<br/>
     	 <b>Context context = new ModelTestContext();</b> <br/>
     	 Rather, it is a (inner) subclass of it named <b>ModelTestContext</b>.<br/>
     	 This might be handy, if you don't want to change the existing test until you are sure that the fixed guided test works. In that case, you modify the <b>ModelTestContext</b> inner class 
         by introducing the needed methods and your perform your debugging process. Once your guided test is correct, you just have to report the methods from the inner class to the existing test.<br/>
         You can now delete your fixed guided test.
