      <intro>
         While implementing new steps in an existing graph, or when you want to focus specifically on a portion of a graph, it might take a long time to reach the exact path you would like to go thru making debugging difficult. Therefore it  would be useful to have a kind of a guided path which only includes a subset of the model edges (golden path). Once debugged your golden path you can forget it and have more usual random paths for better coverage.
