         In order to understand GW4E performance build, you need to configure and enable the performance logging.<br/>
         Once enabled you will have to launch a project build and then you will retrieve the data. You will have then an opportunity to see some performance kpis.<br/>
         Notice that you also have the ability to define thresholds in order to quickly identify which graph model files take more than these thresholds while being parsed or analyzed.

         title="Configuring the thresholds">
      <description> 
         When a build is performed, there are 2 logged KPIs  :<br/>
         <b>1-</b> The time taken to parse a graph model file : <b>gw4e-eclipse-plugin/perf/builders/GW4EParserImpl/Parsing</b><br/>
         <b>2-</b> The time spent to analyzed  a graph model file  : <b>gw4e-eclipse-plugin/perf/builders/GW4EParserImpl/Analysing</b><br/>
         You can define a threshold  for each of these KPIs.<br/>
         
         Right click the project and select <b>Properties</b><br/>
         Select <b>GW4E</b> in the left pane<br/>
         Locate the <b>Performance Configuration</b> section <br/>
         A list of properties are displayed in a 'property - value' like format :<b>property=value</b><br/>
         <br/>
         You can see the 2 KPIs just described above.<br/>
         Modify the default value <b>800</b> to <b>1</b>.<br/>
         Check the <b>Enable Performance Logging</b> check box button<br/>
         Click <b>Apply</b> then <b>OK</b><br/>
         Select in the main toolbar menu <b>Project</b> -&gt; <b>Clean</b>  -&gt; and click <b>OK</b><br/>
         Click the <b>GW4E Plugin Performance</b> tab view <br/>
         In the upper right corner of the view, click the arrow down icon <b>"Refresh Performance Statistics"</b><br/>
         Statistics are now displayed. Notice the icons in the <b>"Failure"</b> columns. Warnings are displayed when the time spent to process is upper than the value set in the preferences.<br/>
     	  <br/>
     	 You learned here how to configure the plugin in order to understand how fast the GW4E process is.
