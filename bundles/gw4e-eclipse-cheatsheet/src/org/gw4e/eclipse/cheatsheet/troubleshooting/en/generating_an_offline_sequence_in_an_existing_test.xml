      title="Generating in an existing test and Debugging it">
   <intro>
      <description>
          In this scenario, we can imagine that you already have a test that works fine. You've updated model with few new nodes and edges and you want to statically (<b>Offline</b> mode ) make sure that the test will work when running with the dynamic way (<b>Online</b> mode ).<br/>
          You will not not choose to create a new class and you will not necessarily want to separate physically the new static test and the existing test<br/>
          After using the wizard, you will have a class ready to run. In a real life, you may not have too much work since you've inherited from an existing test.<br/>

          Open the <b>src/main/resources/com.company/build.policies</b> file <br/>
          Append the following policy : <b>a_star(reached_vertex(v_VerifyPreferencePage));I</b> to this file<br/>
          Save the file<br/>
          Right click the <b>src/main/resources/com.company/Simple.json</b> file and select <b>GW4E</b> -&gt;  <b>Convert to...</b><br/>
          Click the <b>Java Offline Test based</b> radio button <br/>
          Click <b>Next</b><br/>
          Click <b>Append mode</b><br/>
          Select <b>SimpleOffLineImpl.java</b> as class name<br/>
          Select <b>a_star(reached_vertex(v_VerifyPreferencePage))</b><br/>
          Click <b>Finish</b><br/>
          A method is appended at the end of the  <b>SimpleOffLineImpl.java</b> file. Have a look, at the end of the file, you will see a method similar to :<br/>
          @Test<br/>
			public void  test_1494190876844() {<br/>
				System.out.println("Generated with : a_star(reached_vertex(v_VerifyPreferencePage))");<br/>
				e_StartApp();<br/>
				v_VerifyAppRunning();<br/>
				e_OpenPreferencesPage();<br/>
				v_VerifyPreferencePage();<br/>
		  }<br/>

      <description>
          Set a breakpoint in the <b>e_OpenPreferencesPage()</b> method <br/>
   	      Right-Click the <b>SimpleOffLineImpl.java</b> and select <b>Debug as</b> -&gt; <b>GW4E Test</b>.<br/>
      	  <br/>
      	  At this point, the test is launched and the Eclipse Debugger stops where you set the breakpoint. <br/>  
		  Now you can step in and out the java code !<br/>
		  Resume the test so that it ends. Test outputs are displayed in the Console view.<br/>
