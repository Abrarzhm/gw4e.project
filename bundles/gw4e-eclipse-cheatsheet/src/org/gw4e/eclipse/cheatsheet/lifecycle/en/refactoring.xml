   <intro>
      <description>
         It is useful sometimes to rename or move artifacts from a folder to another one. As you might have seen in the previous tutorials some annotations or file contain data related to resource locations.
       The test interface name derives directly from the graph name. In fact only the extension is changed from ".json" to ".java".<br/>
 		The test implementation name follows the same rule except that a suffix is added to the name. The default suffix is <b>Impl</b>.<br/> 
 		For example, a graph model named <b>MyGraph.json</b> will result into an interface named <b>MyGraph.java</b> and a test implementation named <b>MyGraphImpl.java</b><br/>
         GW4E Plugin refactoring is about updating names and path to resource location so that we keep everything in synch with artifacts names and locations.<br/>

      <description>
        As you can see, the java Amazon test suffix is "Test" (ShoppinCart<b>Test</b>). We need to update the project default suffix so that we are aligned with this pattern. <br/>
		Right click the project and select <b>Properties</b><br/>
 		Select <b>GW4E</b> in the left pane<br/>
 		Locate the <b>Test Impl. Suffix</b> text field in the right pane<br/>
 		Replace <b>Impl</b> by <b>Test</b> value and click <b>OK</b><br/><br/>

        Right click the ShoppingCart.json file<br/>
        Select <b>Refactor -&gt; Rename...</b> , a dialog opens <br/>
        Enter <b>MyShoppingCart.json</b> and click <b>OK</b><br/>
        In the <b>Package Explorer</b> , you can see that the test has been renamed to <b>MyShoppingCartTest</b><br/>
        Double-click this file , the <b>@Generated</b> annotation has also been updated according to the new name <b>MyShoppingCart.json</b> <br/>
        In the <b>Package Explorer</b>, you can see that the test interface has been renamed to <b>MyShoppingCart</b><br/><br/>
        Double click the build.policies file, the file is opened<br/>
        The <b>ShoppingCart.json</b>=... entry is now <b>MyShoppingCart.json</b>=...<br/>

        In the <b>Package Explorer</b>, select <b>src/test/resources</b><br/>
        In the main toolbar, click the <b>New Java Package</b> button, a dialog is opened<br/>
        Enter <b>mypack</b> and click <b>OK</b><br/>
        
        Drag and Drop the <b>MyShoppingCart.json</b> file to the<b>mypack</b> package<br/>
        The file is moved in the package with a new build.policies file configured for it.<br/>
        
        In the <b>Package Explorer</b>, you can see that the test interface has been moved as expected into the <b>generated-test-sources</b> folder<br/>
        In the <b>Package Explorer</b>, you can see that the test implementation has been moved as expected into the <b>src/test/java</b> folder<br/>
       
        Double-click the MyShoppingCartTest.java file , the <b>@Generated</b> annotation has also been updated according to the new path <b>src/test/resources/mypack/MyShoppingCart.json</b> <br/>
        Double-click the MyShoppingCart.java file , the <b>@Model</b> annotation has also been updated according to the new path <b>mypack/MyShoppingCart.json</b> <br/>
        
        Double click the java-amazon/src/main/resources/org/graphwalker/build.policies file, the file is opened<br/>
        The <b>ShoppingCart.json</b>=... entry has gone as expected<br/>
        Double click the  java-amazon/src/test/resources/mypack/build.policies file, the file is opened<br/>
        The <b>MyShoppingCart.json</b>=... entry has been added with the expected values<br/>
