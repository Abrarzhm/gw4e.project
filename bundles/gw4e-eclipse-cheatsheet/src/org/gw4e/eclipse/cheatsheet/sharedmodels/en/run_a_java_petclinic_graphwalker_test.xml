            Before being able to run the PetClinic Sample, we need to run a web server that will handle the petclinic request.<br/>
   			Run a shell and execute the following steps in order to get and start the PetClinic Sample Application : <br/>
   			<b>0</b> - In a command shell, create a temporary directory and make it your current directory<br/>
   			<b>1</b> - git clone https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-petclinic.git<br/>
			<b>2</b> - cd spring-petclinic<br/>
			<b>3</b> - git reset --hard 482eeb1c217789b5d772f5c15c3ab7aa89caf279<br/>
			<b>4</b> - mvn tomcat7:run<br/>
			<b>5</b> - Wait until the server is started. You should a log similar to <b>INFO: Starting ProtocolHandler ..</b> <br/>
			We are now ready to launch the PetClinic test.

      <description>
  	    In the main menu, select <b>Run</b>-&gt;<b>Run Configuration...</b><br/>
  	    In the left pane, expand <b>GW4E Test Launcher</b><br/>
  	    Click the <b>New</b> icon <br/>
  	    Click the <b>Browse</b> button to select the <b>java-petclinic</b> project<br/>
  	    Make sure the <b>com.company.modelimplementations.PetClinic</b> is the <b>Main Execution Context</b> selected in the list box. This is the entry point of the test.<br/>
  	    We need to add the other models that this test needs to be executed. The launcher can help you to determine which shared models can be used for this test.<br/>
  	    When clicking <b>Hint</b> check box, project models are parsed to look for candidates models by using the SHARED vertices name.<br/>
  	    Click the <b>Hint</b> check box. 
  	    Click the <b>Select All</b> button <br/>
  	    Click Apply<br/>
   		Click Run<br/>
   		Be patient, the test might take some time before completing...<br/>
  	   <br/>
  	   Results are printed in the Eclipse console. You might notice in the report, the following : <br/>
  	    <b>"totalCompletedNumberOfModels": 5</b><br/>
  	    As you can see, all models have been used in the tests.
